# BossTrollRework - Introduction

BossTroll is a project that was started 2017 by pxav. It allows server admins to troll their players in a new way. Due to own and innovative troll features it gives variety to the common alternatives.



#### ● Why a rework?

Since the old version of BossTroll gave players the ability to crash the minecraft client of other players, it was banned from SpigotMC.org. Because the old source code wasn't clean either, I decided to completely recode the entire plugin.



## Features

BossTroll is divided into three major feature categories: *Tools*, *Server* and *Player*.



#### ● Server:

| Name        | Function                                                     |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| HackMessage | Sends a message made of titles, sounds and normal messages to simulate that the server is hacked at the moment |
| TeleportAll | All players on the server are teleported to you.             |



#### ● Tools: 

| Name          | Function                                                     |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Fireball      | A Fireball projectile is launched which causes an explosion at its landing location |
| SnowCanon     | Snowballs are shot as a projectile                           |
| Lava Bow      | When an arrow of this bow lands on the ground, a lava block will be placed at its landing location. |
| Web Bow       | When an arrow of this bow lands on the ground, a cob web will be placed at its landing location. |
| Creeper Bow   | When an arrow of this bow lands on the ground, a creeper will be spawned at its landing location. |

| Explosion Bow | Creates an explosion at the landing location.                |
| Fire Bow      | When an arrow of this bow lands on the ground, a fire block will be spawned at its landing location. |

## TODO

- Make the plugin compatible with more versions
- Fix the LagPlayerConnectionTroll
- Add more server trolls



## Support

**Important note:** This repository only contains the 1.8 source code. This code might not work with older versions due to other sound names, etc. More versions will release without the source code.
